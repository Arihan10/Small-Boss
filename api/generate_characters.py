Character Generation Script
Uses Claude 4.5 Sonnet to generate a small rural town with 20 characters.
Map includes: Park, Pool, Soccer Field, Farmer Market, Campfire, School, Farm, Library, Hospital, and Houses.
Two-shot approach:
1. Generate background stories for all characters
2. Parse and populate relationships, demographics, appearances, and locations

Create {NUM_CHARACTERS} unique characters with rich, interconnected backgrounds. This is a close-knit rural community.

THE TOWN MAP INCLUDES:
- Park (peaceful area for gatherings)
- Pool (community swimming pool)
- Soccer Field (sports and recreation)
- Farmer Market stands (local produce and goods)
- Campfire area (community gathering spot)
- School (middle building - education center)
- Farm (back building with cows and chickens)
- Library (left building - knowledge center)
- Hospital/Nurse station (rightmost building with beds and IV stands)
- Several residential houses

JOB DISTRIBUTION BY LOCATION:
{locations_desc}

Requirements:
- Include families (parents, children, siblings, spouses) - but families should have INTERNAL CONFLICTS
- Mix of ages (children 5-17, adults 18-60, elders 60+)
- Various occupations from the list above
- Complex relationships (friends, rivals, family, romantic interests)
- Diverse ethnicities (realistic human races - White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, etc.)
- Each person should have meaningful connections to at least 2-3 others
- IMPORTANT: CREATE DRAMA AND TENSION:
  * Include love triangles, unrequited love, secret crushes
  * Create rivalries, grudges, old conflicts that still simmer
  * Add family drama (estranged siblings, disappointed parents, rebellious children)
  * Include workplace tensions, professional jealousies
  * Create conflicting goals and competing interests between characters
  * Add secrets, betrayals, and unresolved issues
- IMPORTANT: Each character needs clear BEHAVIORAL TRAITS that guide their decisions:
  * Ambition level (low/medium/high)
  * Confrontational tendency (low/medium/high)
  * Sociability (low/medium/high)
  * Core life motivation (what they want: family, love, power, knowledge, safety, adventure, etc.)
  * Other decision-guiding traits (protective, curious, cautious, impulsive, etc.)

For EACH of the {NUM_CHARACTERS} characters, write a background paragraph that includes:
1. Their name, age, and occupation (from the jobs list above)
2. Where they work/spend time (specific location on the map)
3. Their core personality dimensions (ambition level, confrontational tendency)
4. What they want in life (core motivations like "take care of family", "find love", "gain respect", "escape poverty")
5. Their family connections AND family tensions/conflicts
6. Important relationships with other townspeople - emphasize DRAMA:
   - Romantic interests (unrequited love, love triangles, complicated attractions)
   - Rivalries and antagonistic relationships
   - Betrayals, grudges, or past conflicts
   - Professional jealousies or competing ambitions
7. A brief life story with emphasis on conflicts and tensions

Format each character as:
---
CHARACTER [number]
[Background paragraph]
---

Make the town feel like a DRAMATIC SOAP OPERA with interconnected stories, LOTS of conflicts, romantic tensions, family drama, rivalries, and complicated dynamics. This should feel like a reality TV show where everyone has beef with someone!"""

    "energy": <0-100>,

    "hygiene": <0-100>
  }}
}}

IMPORTANT:
1. Choose appearance codes that fit rural/modern setting (e.g., worker boots for farmers, casual wear for students)
2. PERSONALITY TRAITS must be DECISION-GUIDING, not just descriptive. Include:
   - "ambition: low/medium/high" (how driven are they?)
   - "confrontational: low/medium/high" (do they avoid or seek conflict?)
   - "sociable: low/medium/high" (do they seek company or solitude?)
   - "core_motivation: [specific goal]" (what do they want in life?)
   - Additional behavioral traits that affect decisions (protective, curious, cautious, impulsive, loyal, etc.)
3. Create relationships BETWEEN the characters (use their names) - EMPHASIZE DRAMA:
   - Each character should have 4-6 relationships minimum
   - AT LEAST 30-40% of relationships should be negative/tense (scores below 20)
   - Include love triangles (Person A loves Person B who loves Person C)
   - Include rivalries and antagonistic relationships (negative scores)
   - Include complicated family dynamics (even family can have low scores due to conflict)
   - Use relationship_type "Romantic" for crushes, attractions, or complicated feelings
   - Use relationship_type "Rival" for antagonistic relationships
4. Ensure family relationships are bidirectional (if A is B's parent, B is A's child) - but scores can differ!
5. Relationship scores: 
   - 80-100 (deep love/very positive) 
   - 40-80 (positive/friendly)
   - 20-40 (neutral/awkward)
   - 0-20 (tense/uncomfortable)
   - -20-0 (dislike/conflict)
   - -40--20 (strong dislike/rivalry)
   - -100--40 (hatred/hostility)
   USE THE FULL RANGE! Don't just make everyone friendly.
6. Set reasonable initial needs (most people around 50-70)
