# AI Life Simulation - Unity Backend API

FastAPI backend for an AI-powered life simulation game built with Unity. This API manages character AI, relationships, and conversations using Claude 4.5 Sonnet.

## 🎯 Unity Integration Focus

This backend is designed to work seamlessly with Unity:
- **Unity owns:** Positions, movement, physics, rendering, spatial data
- **Backend owns:** Character AI, relationships, memories, dialogue generation

## Features

- **AI Character Decisions** - Characters decide what to do based on personality and context
- **Bidirectional Relationships** - Asymmetric feelings (A likes B more than B likes A)
- **AI-Generated Dialogue** - Realistic conversations based on personality and relationships
- **Automatic Relationship Creation** - First interactions create relationships automatically
- **Memory Formation** - Characters remember conversations and events
- **Space Context Generation** - AI describes what's happening in locations

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

Create `.env` file:

```env
MONGO_DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ai_life_sim
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

### 3. Generate & Load Characters

```bash
# Generate 20 medieval town characters with AI
python generate_characters.py

# Load into MongoDB
python load_to_mongo.py
```

### 4. Start API Server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

API runs at: `http://localhost:8000`

## 🎮 Unity Integration Flow

### Game Initialization

```csharp
async void Start() {
    // Load all characters
    var characters = await GET("/characters");
    
    // Instantiate character GameObjects
    foreach (var character in characters) {
        InstantiateCharacter(character);
    }
}
```

### Character Movement

```csharp
async void OnCharacterReachDestination(Character character, string spaceName) {
    // 1. Generate space context
    var nearbyCharNames = GetCharacterNamesInSpace(spaceName);
    var spaceContext = await POST("/context/generate-space-context", new {
        space_name = spaceName,
        characters_present = nearbyCharNames
    });
    
    // 2. Display description
    ShowSpaceDescription(spaceContext.description);
    
    // 3. Character makes decision about new location
    var decision = await POST($"/characters/{character.id}/decide", new {
        trigger_source = "arrived at new location",
        space_context = new {
            current_space = spaceName,
            description = spaceContext.description,
            nearby_characters = nearbyCharNames,
            available_objects = GetObjectsInSpace(spaceName)
        },
        global_context = new {
            time = GameTime.current,
            day = GameTime.dayNumber,
            weather = Weather.current
        }
    });
    
    // 4. Execute AI's decision
    ExecuteAction(character, decision.action);
}
```

### Executing AI Actions

```csharp
void ExecuteAction(Character character, Action action) {
    switch (action.actionType) {
        case "move":
            var destination = action.props["destination"];
            character.MoveTo(FindLocation(destination));
            break;
            
        case "initiate_conversation":
            var targetName = action.props["target_character"];
            var targetChar = FindCharacterByName(targetName);
            StartConversation(character, targetChar);
            break;
            
        case "use_object":
            var objectName = action.props["object_name"];
            UseObject(character, objectName);
            break;
            
        case "wait":
            character.Wait(5f);
            break;
            
        case "continue":
            // Keep doing current activity
            break;
    }
}
```

### Conversation System

```csharp
async void StartConversation(Character char1, Character char2) {
    // Start session
    var session = await POST("/interaction-sessions/", new {
        character_ids = new[] { char1.id, char2.id },
        interaction_type = "dialog"
    });
    
    // Lock characters
    char1.isInteracting = true;
    char2.isInteracting = true;
    
    // Show UI
    ShowConversationBubble(char1, char2);
    
    // Auto-advance conversation
    StartCoroutine(ConversationLoop(session.id));
}

IEnumerator ConversationLoop(string sessionId) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {  // 6 messages max
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(3f);
        
        var response = await POST($"/interaction-sessions/{sessionId}/advance");
        var lastMsg = response.messages[response.messages.Count - 1];
        
        ShowDialogue(lastMsg.character_name, lastMsg.content);
    }
    
    // End conversation
    await POST($"/interaction-sessions/{sessionId}/end");
    HideConversationBubble();
    char1.isInteracting = false;
    char2.isInteracting = false;
}
```

## 📊 Data Models

### Character
```json
{
  "_id": "...",
  "name": "Marcus Blackwood",
  "age": 16,
  "race": "Black",
  "gender": "Male",
  "occupation": "Student",
  "background": "The middle Blackwood child...",
  "personality_traits": [
    "ambition: high",
    "confrontational: medium",
    "sociable: high",
    "core_motivation: escape this small town and find adventure",
    "impulsive", "brave", "insecure"
  ],
  "appearance": {
    "hair": 4,
    "shoes": 1,
    "bottom": 3,
    "top": 7
  },
  "needs": {
    "happiness": 55,
    "energy": 80,
    "hunger": 70,
    "hygiene": 50
  },
  "current_desire": "find Isabella and talk to her",
  "action_log": [...],
  "memory_log": [...],
  "relationships": ["char_id_1", "char_id_2"]
}
```

### Bidirectional Relationship
```json
{
  "_id": "...",
  "character_id_1": "marcus_id",
  "character_id_2": "isabella_id",
  
  "char1_relationship_type": "Romantic",
  "char1_summary": "Has an intense crush on her",
  "char1_score": 80,
  "char1_interaction_history": [...],
  
  "char2_relationship_type": "Friendly",
  "char2_summary": "Finds him annoying but amusing",
  "char2_score": 45,
  "char2_interaction_history": [...],
  
  "current_interaction_state": "none"
}
```

**Key Point:** Single document, different perspectives. Marcus likes Isabella (80) more than Isabella likes Marcus (45).

## 🧠 How AI Works

### Decision Making
1. Unity calls `.decide()` with current context
2. Backend gathers: personality, needs, memories, relationships
3. Claude AI analyzes and decides action
4. Returns: state changes + action to execute
5. Unity executes the action

### Conversations
1. Characters start talking (Unity or AI triggered)
2. Backend auto-creates relationships if first meeting
3. AI generates realistic dialogue turn-by-turn
4. When ending: AI summarizes and updates relationships
5. Each character can feel differently about the same conversation

### Relationships
- Bidirectional: Single document, two perspectives
- Asymmetric: Scores can be very different
- Auto-updating: Conversations change scores
- Memory-linked: Interaction histories tracked

## 🎭 Example: Marcus's Day in Unity

```
1. Game starts → Unity loads Marcus from /characters
2. Unity spawns Marcus at Residential District
3. Unity calls Marcus.decide("character spawned")
   → AI returns: {action: {actionType: "move", props: {destination: "Town Square"}}}
4. Unity moves Marcus to Town Square
5. Unity calls /context/generate-space-context
   → AI returns: "Marcus is looking around. Isabella is at her stall."
6. Unity calls Marcus.decide("arrived at new location")
   → AI sees Isabella nearby (crush, score 80)
   → AI returns: {action: {actionType: "initiate_conversation", props: {target_character: "Isabella Cortez"}}}
7. Unity starts conversation between Marcus & Isabella
8. Unity calls /advance every 3 seconds
   → AI Marcus: "Hey Isabella!"
   → AI Isabella: "Marcus, I'm working..."
9. After 4-6 messages, Unity calls /end
   → AI analyzes conversation
   → Updates: Marcus→Isabella +3, Isabella→Marcus -1
   → Both get memories
10. Characters unlocked, cycle continues
```
